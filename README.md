# masters-betting
For a Masters sweepstake.

The program splits the entire Masters field between any chosen number of bettors.

Players are grouped into ranking blocks, the size of which depends on the number of players. The blocks are then randomised and the players are assigned to the bettors in order. Every bettor should end up with a good mix of better and worse golfers. 

The .exe file in the dist folder should run independently.
All code is given in masters.py.

The names.txt file contains the names of golfers in ranked order as listed on SkyBet on the 5th of April 2022 for the 2022. They can be copied and pasted in the current format.
