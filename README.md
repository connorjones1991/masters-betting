# masters-betting
For a Masters sweepstake. The program splits the entire Masters field between any chosen number of bettors. Players are grouped into ranking blocks, the size of which depends on the number of players. The blocks are then randomised and the players are assigned to the bettors in order. Every bettor should end up with a good mix of better and worse golfers.
